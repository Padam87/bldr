Welcome to Bldr's documentation!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bldr, in the simplest terms, is a build system, written with yaml configs. If you are used to build systems,
you've probably seen some pretty complicated build files, and they were probably written in xml.

Well, here's one written for Bldr:

                - prepare
                - lint
                - phpcs
                - test

    tasks:
        prepare:

            calls:

        phpcs:

For now (while im still working on the documentation), this will hopefully serve as ample documentation.
